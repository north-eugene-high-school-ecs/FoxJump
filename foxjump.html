	<p>This is the game I made about a fox. The fox is running through the woods to find food, and there is a hill in the way. The fox starts running up the hill, but logs start rolling down from trees that were knocked over in the recent storm. <br> My game was supposed to be a timing game, so I made a jumping game where you had to jump over the logs at just the right time to survive. I chose to do a fox because it's always been my favorite animal, and I based everything else on that. <br> To play the game, all you need to do is start it up and press the space bar to jump after the fox is done talking. The logs will begin to roll by, and you need to press the space bar at just the right time to make the fox jump over them. </p>
